# Cake CSS

Minimalistic and responsive tiny CSS library.

Cake CSS provides you the minimum set of things you will need to start your development: a grid system, responsive layout, customizable boxes, buttons and headers, and a set of fonts. Do you need more? Cake CSS is fully hackable. Just change whatever you need or add your custom CSS!

When I say Cake CSS is a tiny library, it means it only has 2KB! Minified version, I mean.

### Install

Just install it using Yarn or NPM.

#### Using Yarn

    yarn add cake-css

#### Using NPM

    npm install cake-css

### Usage

And then simply import the stylesheet on your `index.html` file.

    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/path/to/cake/cake.min.css">

#### CDN

    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://unpkg.com/cake-css@0.0.3/build/dist/cake.min.css">

### Acknowledgements

Cake CSS is strongly influenced by:

* [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getboostrap.com)
* [Min CSS](http://mincss.com)

Also this is possible thanks to  [Coolors.co](https://coolors.co/) and their palette generator.
